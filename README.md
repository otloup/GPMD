# Test for PHP developers

We would like to ask your cooperation to help us to measure your debugging and intuitive skills.
Feel free to contact us if you need more guidance, in many cases good questions are more important
than the fix itself, sometimes the correction turns out as not necessary.

## Task one: debugging

First of all we would like to measure your intuitive debugging skills required for the position. The
`hotel.php` file contains a simple class and some php code, with some extra bugs and bad practices. 
Your goal is to clean up the code within an hour to the acceptable level – we would like to see what 
you think about bad practices and 'acceptable' – and send it back as soon as it's possible. There are 
no rules, new files, refactoring, structure, check, tests, you name it. Make the code "yours", the 
type of code you like to see.

## Task two: understanding database structures

The second part is an SQL query. You will have to have a mysql server around to use the included
`products.sql` dump, you should be familiar with EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) structures, this is a
small part from a Magento database containing a subset of a product dataset. We need a small sql
query displaying the product sku, product name and the price, formatting is not required. For those
not familiar with Magento database structure you will have to begin querying catalog_product_entity
and tables beginning with this, the keys between the tables use entity_id. You can find more specs
on the internet, but they are normally not necessary for understanding the task.

Thank you!
